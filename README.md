# nimble
nimble is a fast, accurate, and configurable bulk RNA sequence aligner that executes lightweight alignments on arbitrary reference libraries. It uses pseudo-alignment to rapidly generate supplemental calls to complement a data pipeline's primary alignment. It does this with low overhead, making it possible to run supplemental alignments on any machine.


# Installation

nimble's only dependency is Python 3. It runs on the following operating systems:

- Windows
- MacOS
- Ubuntu
- CentOS 7
- Manjaro

To install nimble, run the following command:

`pip install git+https://github.com/BimberLab/nimble`
